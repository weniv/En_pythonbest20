The blacksmith Gary is requesting offers swords for 3000 won per piece, and if he sharpens the blade, an additional 300 won is added. As a regular customer, one unsharpened sword is provided for every 10 swords, and one sharpened sword is provided for every 100 swords.

## Input and Output Examples

| Input                                  | Output  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 100 | 0 |
| 36600 | 12 |
| 66600 | 22 |

---

## Explanation

- If the budget is 100 won, Gary can buy 0 swords.
- If the budget is 36600 won, Gary can get 12 sharpened swords. (3300 won * 11 + (complimentary sword * 1 + 300) = 36600 won)
- If the budget is 66600 won, Gary can get 22 sharpened swords. (3300 won * 20 + (complimentary sword * 2 + 300 * 2) = 66600 won)
