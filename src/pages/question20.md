## Explanation for Examples

The function takes two inputs: 
1. A two-dimensional array that contains the name, price, and priority of ingredients
2. The budget

The function should return an array of ingredients that can be purchased in order of priority.

For example, let's say the following inputs are given: [['milk', 'egg', 'butter', 'chocolate cinnamon', 'pineapple', 'cream'], [10, 5, 5, 18, 6, 3], [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]] and 10 for budget. If we arrange the ingredients in order of priority, we get ['milk', 'butter', 'egg', 'chocolate cinnamon', 'pineapple', 'cream']. Since only milk, which costs 10, can be purchased within the given budget of 10, the function should return ['milk'].
