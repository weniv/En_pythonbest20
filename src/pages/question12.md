## Problem Description
NPC SoulGom gained a soul and can now eat human food. She wants to visit her favorite Spicy Hot Pot restaurant. However, she doesn't know how much she should eat, and she may not be able to visit the mine frequently, so she wants to eat as many ingredients as possible.

The ingredients for Spicy Hot Pot are given below, and the maximum number of ingredients that can be added per each ingredient is given in an array.

```text
[Tofu, Mushroom, Vermicelli, Bean Sprouts, Chinese Chive, Cabbage, Potato, Meat]
```

Adjacent ingredients cannot be put together because they don't complement each other. Print out the maximum amount of ingredients that SoulGom can take.

## Constraints

 - The maximum number of ingredients that can be taken for each type of ingredient is displayed as a number in an array. For example, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40]` means that 1 block of tofu, 2 mushrooms, 3 servings of vermicelli, 4 servings of bean sprouts, 10 Chinese chives, 20 cabbage leaves, 30 potato slices, and 40 pieces of meat can be taken. 
 - The maximum number of ingredients that can be put into the Spicy Hot Pot is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000.

## Explanation for Examples

An array of the number of Spicy Hot Pot ingredients, `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 8, 8, 6]`, is given as input.

If you put 2 ingredients of tofu, you cannot put 4 mushrooms, which are adjacent ingredients. Therefore, skip one and add 1 to the next number. This process should be repeated and the maximum value obtained should be compared to get the maximum sum of the ingredients.

The maximum value that can be obtained when starting with 2 is 19 (2+3+8+6). However, if you start with 4, you can get 21 (4+3+8+6). Therefore, the answer is 21.
